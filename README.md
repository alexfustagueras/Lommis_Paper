# Lommis App Project

This is a Python-based project focused on detecting flight movement events at Lommis Airport, with the potential to be extended to other airports in the future.
It combines several tools to process, analyze and visualize ADS-B traffic data, using:

* Custom functions written in **lommis_func.py**
* The built-in features of traffic library
* Some Machine Learning models trained specifically for this task

The main notebook is **main.ipynb**, which goes through the full workflow â€” from loading and cleaning the data to detecting events and visualizing the results.
